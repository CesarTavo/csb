CINNAMON SlackBuilds
=====================

This repository provides SlackBuild scripts to build and install the CINNAMON
desktop environment (http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com) on top of Slackware Linux.
The Cinnamon packages are built with a minimum set of dependencies, but still
provides a working desktop.

Binary packages of Cinnamon for Slackware 14.1 for both ARCH (x86 and x86_64)
can be obtained from : http://www.slackware.uk/csb/. Binaries are built
against Slackware 14.1.

If you have custom installation, building from the source is the recommended
way to make sure it is linked with the libraries available on your machine.

How to build and install the CINNAMON packages using these scripts:

1.  Clone the Git repo or download a tarball/zip of the repo.

2.  You may want to read NOTES before building

3.  Install bash-completion from /extra before building the packages.

4.  Run libtest.sh script in test-script directory as root to make sure your
    libraries are not corrupted. These errors are safe and can be ignored:
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/htmlview': No such file or directory
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/krdb': No such file or directory
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/pnmnoraw': No such file or directory
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/pnmtoplainpnm': No such file or directory
    If you get a result of Invalid ELF header, that means one of your libraries
    are corrupted and must be fixed first before building this packages.

5.  Build the packages according to the BUILD_ORDER manually.
    If you wish to run an automated build script, please use the 'build-cinnamon.sh'
    in the root directory which will build and install all the cinnamon packages
    including the necessary dependencies.
    NOTE: In certain cases, the automated build script *may* failed.
    Some known issues are documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.

6.  Once the packages are built and installed, you can use 'xwmconfig' 
    to select the cinnamon session. Run startx to start Cinnamon Desktop.

7.  Enjoy and let me know of any issues or suggestions/improvements. 
    Email is: willysr@slackware-id.org

SPECIAL NOTE for CURRENT USERS: Please use "development" branch instead of master.

Thanks!
