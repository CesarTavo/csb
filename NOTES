NOTES
=====================

1. I'm using the latest Slackware release as base (currently 14.2).

2. PAM is needed to build several core packages of cinnamon. I have
   tried to avoid this, but it seems to be inevitable.

3. I tried to avoid systemd on this repository. So far, it worked.

4. Some code in cinnamon packages are hardcoded to /usr/lib, so even
   in x86_64, they will be installed in /usr/lib to avoid breakage.

5. I removed webkit-related screensaver in cinnamon-screensaver to avoid
   building webkitgtk which is very time consuming. It still has the
   default screensaver that is able to lock your desktop (only requires PAM).
