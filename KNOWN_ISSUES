KNOWN ISSUES
=====================
- locking still doesn't work. Probably related to PAM or ConsoleKit
- Launching terminal from nemo shortcut did not work since they are not yet defined.
  Use this command to set it to other terminal (eg. xfce4-terminal)
  Thanks to Michael Amadio
  gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec xfce4-terminal
